# python-tdd-todo-app

#This app is an example of test-driven development in action. 
#It is written using the Python language (with some HTML and JavaScript) and utilizes the technologies Django, SQLite3, GeckoDriver, and Selenium.

#This app is a simple todo list app that utilizes a full stack to create a simple series of todo lists that are linked to one's email.

#Within the project structure you will find the code itself as well as the unit and functional tests that were used to guide its development.
#This project was created under the guidance of the book, 'Test Driven Development with Python: Obey the Testing Goat, using Django, Selenium and JavaScript' by Harry J.W. Percival.

#I hope you enjoy this simple application :)
