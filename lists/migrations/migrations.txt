Migrations is a Django feature that shows one what models have been sent to the SQLite3 database -- when a new model is created,
it is sent to the Django database via the usage of the command 'python manage.py makemigrations' when a model is made or deleted, 
or 'python manage.py migrate' when a model is edited.
